Share your thoughts on a book with the "Write a Review" feature. Rate your reads, provide opinions, and specify when you started and finished reading.

### Reading Reviews

Once a review is submitted for a book, users can easily access and review their own opinions on their reads. This feature enhances the personal aspect of the Book Library Project, allowing users to track their thoughts and experiences with each book in their collection.

### New Book vs. After Review

![New Book vs. After Review](https://github.com/deividasdul/book-library/assets/145572945/a51c8168-b312-474e-b103-5e684a4b267a)

Discover the difference between a newly added book and one that has been reviewed. Freshly added books will have a "Write a Review" button, allowing users to share their thoughts on the book. Once a review is submitted, the button changes to "Read," enabling users to revisit their review and thoughts on the book.

## Roadmap

As I continue to develop and refine the Book Library Project, here are some enhancements I plan to implement:

- **Sort by Functionality:** Introduce sorting options to enhance browsing efficiency.
- **Design Improvements:** Enhance the visual appeal and user experience through refined design elements.
- **Bug Fixes:** Address any issues, such as occasional misdirection when clicking on "Read".
- **Code Refactoring:** Optimize code for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Layout Enhancements:** Fine-tune page layouts for enhanced usability.

I'm excited about the future of the Book Library Project and look forward to delivering an even more enriching experience for book lovers everywhere!
